     yorick-av - write movies in Yorick using LibAV 
 
This plug-in uses the LibAV / FFmpeg family of libraries (libavformat,
libavcodec, libavutils, libswscale...) to write movies from within
Yorick.

In essence, it is a compatible rewrite of the ympeg plug-in, but
instead of shipping its own, trimmed-down version of FFmpeg, libav
uses the full-featured LibAV (or FFmpeg). This allows using more
recent codecs such as h.264, MP4 / DivX, Ogg/Vorbis.

libav-mpeg.i provides a drop-in replacement for mpeg.i
avtest.i contains a limited test suite

INSTALLATION

First install libavcodec, libavformat, libavutil and libswscale from
either the LibAV or the FFmpeg project (compatible versions are yet to
check, LibAV 0.8.1 is known to work).

Then as usual for Yorick plug-ins:

yorick -batch make.i
make
make check
make install

USAGE

From within Yorick:

#include "libav.i"
help, av_create
